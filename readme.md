# MeetMe

This is my attempt at writing a social network without the use of big web frameworks.  It's primarily a learning exercise, but if folks want to launch and host the thing somewhere, more power to em!  I don't know why I named it "MeetMe" and it's probably already copywritten somewhere.  Details details...

It's developed using PHP 7 and MySQL with PHPMyAdmin... because why not?

## Getting Started

As mentioned above, just copy the code to your web root.  I used Apache with the WAMP stack, but it should be able to be hosted anywhere that plays well with PHP and MySQL.

### Prerequisites

PHP 7 must be used because of the use of the null coalesce operator.  It's pretty cool.  Look it up.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why
